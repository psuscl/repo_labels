# Repository Labels

Short labels for frontend headers for selecting and displaying repository names.

This plugin overrides two shared views in the frontend, `header_repository` and `header_user`. In both cases, instead of displaying the repository code itself, the plugin asks to display a translation of that repository code into a short human-readable label. These labels are defined in `frontend/locales/en.yml`.
